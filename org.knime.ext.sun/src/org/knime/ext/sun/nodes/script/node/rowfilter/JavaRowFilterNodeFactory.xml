    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p>
              Java Snippet based Row Filter. Use the java editor to enter a
              boolean expression that is used to define whether an input row
              is passed to the output. For instance, to filter for every other
              row, you could use an expression such as
            </p>
            <pre>
return $$ROWINDEX$$ % 2 == 0;
            </pre>
            <p>
              This node supports missing values as input, which are represented
              as <tt>null</tt> values. The expression must not return 
              <tt>null</tt>. For a detailed description see also the 
              Java Snippet node.
            </p>

        <option name="Column List">
          The list contains the column that are available in the input table.
          Double click any of the column names to insert the respective field
          in the expression editor. It will replace your current selection or
          simply insert at the current caret position.
        </option>
        <option name="Flow Variable List">
          The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
          the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
          respective identifier at the current cursor position (replacing the
          selection, if any).
        </option>
        <option name="Global Variable Declaration">
          Define global variables here. These variables are available during 
          the execution and they are also modifiable. Names starting with '_'
          (underscore) are discouraged due to potential name conflicts with 
          internally used variables.
        </option>
        <option name="Method Body">
          Enter your java code here (the entire source will be wrapped in a
          method). You can add the name of a variables 
          by double-clicking its name in the left list. Note that numeric 
          (double-compatible) variables will be handled as <tt>Double</tt>,
          int-compatible variables as <tt>Integer</tt> and any other varaible
          type as <tt>String</tt>.
